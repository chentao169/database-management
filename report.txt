In this association rules mining project, I have learnt how to use database to
analyze data and find the relationship between data, and how to use JAVA to 
connect with database and deal with the query results.Specially, through this
project, I built the concept what the data mining is and how to implement it.
Besides, it is a chance for me to practice programming using sql. 

At the beginning of this project, I faced a lot of problems. 
The important one is how to build the development enviroment. For example, 
how to connect JAVA program with oracle. I read the sample code provided by the 
webpage of cise web site. Based on the sample code, I wrote the connection code 
by myself.

Another challenging thing is how to debug the  sql code. If I wrote the sql code
directly in oracle, I had to type it into oralce every time which is inefficient
and boring. At first, I wanted to use the SQL Developer software. Unfortunatelly,
I spent one day configuring it in my laptop, but it could not connect with 
oracle. So I had to figure out another method: I wrote a shell script which
would run the sql code once I run the shell scripte. This method makes it
easier to debug sql code.

Of course, how to implement the apriori rule is another problem. At first, I 
looked up to understand the algorithms of the association rules mining. Then, I 
figured out how to combine the JAVA code with sql code. Because it would take 
several minutes to run JAVA program, I kept in mind how to make the query more
efficient and program simpler. 

Through this program, I practiced programming by using sql a lot. Now I am 
familiar with basic database operation and commom debug method.
